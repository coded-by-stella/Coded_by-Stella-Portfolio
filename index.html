          <h4>2025? A Year of Change and Growth.</h3>
          <p>This year marks a turning point in my life, both personally and professionally.</p>
          <p>Alongside this transition, I invested in my future by starting the <strong>SheCodes Professional Web Development courses</strong>, expanding my skills to become a web developer.</p>
          <p>I combine <strong>web development</strong> with 10+ years of experience in <strong>dental business management, marketing</strong> and <strong>project management</strong>, building websites and marketing strategies that move businesses forward.</p>
          <p>Which means I can support companies not only with web development, social media and web sites maintenance, but also with marketing strategies that drive growth.</p>

            <p><em>“I’m not just coding websites, I’m building bridges between technology, customers and business growth. Because Websites shouldn’t just look good, they should work passively to generate more income.”</em></p>

          <p>My goal is to collaborate with expanding businesses where versatility and hard work are valued.</p>
          <p>I’m eager to bring both tech and marketing skills, supporting different areas if needed (being able to wear multiple hats) and treat the company I work for with the same dedication, responsibility and commitment as if it were my own.</p>
