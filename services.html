          <p><strong>Practical and zero maintenance.</strong> We measure leads and booked calls.</p>

            <li><strong>Compare.</strong> Same numbers at day 30 and day 60 after launch.</li>
            <li><strong>Auto log.</strong> Forms send to your email and to a spreadsheet. Bookings from your scheduler are counted in the same sheet.</li>
